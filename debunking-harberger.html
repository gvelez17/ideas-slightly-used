    <h1 class="title">Debunking Harberger: Why More Force Is Not More Good, and Money is Not a Sufficient Approximation of Utility</h1>

<i><small>Why bother?  I believe the Harberger idea may be used in near future to mass displace people in the favelas in Brazil.  It may actually hurt real people, undermine local control and democracy.  But to go on....</small></i>

<p>The Harberger idea, if you haven't seen, is basically the idea that everything is for sale all the time, and you pick the valuation for property tax purposes but anyone buy your property at that valuation.  This includes land and your house, and the houses of people who didn't agree to it.</p>

<h3>What is Property?</h3>
<p>
Since this concept fundamentally changes the nature of private property, its worth starting with a definition of property.  What does it mean to "own" something?  Does it mean you have a lot of guns and dogs and will kill anyone who tries to take it?  Or does it mean the government has a bunch of guns and dogs and will arrest anyone who tries to take it?
</p><p>
If it does not mean either of those things I might come take your property so owning doesn't seem to mean very much.
</p><p>
Ownership implies force.  If we assume the force is being applied by a "legitimate government", this leads to the next question.
</p>
<h3>What is Government?</h3>
<p>
Plenty of deep history here, but for practical purposes government is the one entity that people agree can apply force to enforce agreed upon rules.  If an entity applying violent force to people is not democratic, representative and have an independent justice system it may better be called a mafia, gang, dictatorship or terrorist entity.  
</p><p>
Non-democratic forms of government that can apply force to individuals who are not represented and have no recourse to justice systems tend to result in fear, abuse and oppression.  Various types of theories have been put forward to support non-democratic governments but in the end they tend to just enrich whoever controls the enforcement of the rules.
</p><p>
Further discussion of government features is beyond the scope of this essay but I would assert that any form of goverment proposed include test cases, and if individuals can be harmed with no recourse then it fails the test.  
</p><p>
The Harberger folks might argue that beyond any considertions of justice, government has some interest in increasing total utility.
</p>
So...

<h3>What is Utility?</h3>
<p>
Utility is what makes you choose what you do next.  By definition, what you choose to do next has the highest utility to you - you are willing to spend the opportunity cost of not doing all the other things you might have done next.
</p>
<p>
Note, utility does not necessarily have any relationship to money.  It might be that someone would offer me a lot of money to backstab my friend (literally or figuratively) but it would not cause me to do it, therefore the money was not a good estimate of my utility.  I might have many values, some that are not constant in time and some that are, that determine my next action, and I might or might not decide to consider some kind of transactional value store that others have agreed on (money) in determining my personal utility.  
</p>
<p>Also when I decide to spend time with family, friends, learning music, walking in nature, doing something I promised, expressing myself through art or words, its quite likely that this decision is unrelated to money, in that the possibility of getting more or less money is unlikely to change my decision of what to do next. 
</p>
<p>
So the relationship between Utility and Money might look something like this:
</p><p>
<img src="total_utility.png" alt="Choice to NOT maximize money may demonstrate increased utility overall"/>

</p><p>

A key thing to note about the Monetizable parts of utility and the Non-monetizable parts, is that they are a bit analogous to reversible and irreversible thermodynamic processes. If you sell your car for money, you can buy it back or one similar.

</p><p>

But if you betray a friend, you cannot buy the friend back.  The utility associated with non-monetaizable values is generally not reversible when lost.  More examples:
<ul>
 <li> life is a primary example.  If you choose to sell someone's life, and they are killed, then you want to buy it back this is not possible. </li> 


 <li> relationships generally are not for sale.  If you damage a relationship with a romantic partner, friend, family member, colleague or fellow soldier in exchange for money, you cannot use the same amount of money to buy the relationship back.</li>

 <li> integrity and reputation are not for sale.  If you break your word or lie, no amount of money will restore the trust of anyone who knows of what happened.  (this is why disinformation wars are so central - the ability to distort truth sometimes can be bought)</li>

 <li> the planet, a kind of macro-life, if damaged beyond a certain point by exploitation cannot be restored.  Destroying any long lived entity such as trees or cacti cannot be retored in a short amount of time by any expense.  One cannot replace a 200 year old tree in less than 200 years.</li>

</ul>
Clearly there are many forms of utility that are not transferable in a reversible way and therefore cannot be mapped to monetizable values.

</p><p>
Back to the concept of utility as the choice of what to do next.

</p><p>
The exception to the impact of money on my decisions would be if money is closely associated with violent force, so that if I spend time with my family or express myself, money transactions that other people make cause me to be violently evicted from my home where I live.  This is more an impact of the violence rather than the money per se, but in a system where money is given the power of violent force and people are frequently displaced by force, then more people will likely change their behavior in relation to money. 

</p><p>
This likely will increase the amount of utility that does correspond to money but will likely reduce other forms of utility, including reducing the total overall utility.

</p><p>
Since utility corresponds to the action a person would take if not subject to violent force, any system that frequently involves physical force very likely reduces the total utility of that system.

</p><p>
A system that involves very infrequent physical force likely has higher overall utility since people are able to make the choices of what behavior to do next that increases their total utility.

</p><p>
<b>Force Decreases Utility</b>

</p><p>
<table align=right bgcolor="eeeeee">
<tr><td>
<pre>
Money != Utility

Free Choice => Utility

More Force => Less Utility
</pre>
</td></Tr></table>

</p><p>
This is a core principle that I hope would be recognized.

</p><p>
What kinds of things would increase total utility?

</p><p>
<b>Tools for Agency</b>

</p><p>
I would say that we actually already have some pretty good instruments for anonymous transctions (forms of money) but we don't have very efficient tools for supporting the kinds of utility that are not transactional.  So more tools that help people intentionally cooperate, or just generally realize their intentions, would be valuable ways to increase total utility.  

</p><p>
Things that help capture intention, turn into reality, and let people recognize when something has value to them so it can be measured and seen by others, would be genuinely useful innovations.

</p><p>
One simple tool that could be useful and what I originally was thinking when I saw the group titled "partial common ownership" would be an instrument for renters to jointly purchase the building or property where they live, and have efficient ways to self-govern the joint ownership by local residents who are all impacted by decisions made.  More on that later.

</p><p>
Another is a new form of corporation that is run by work-weighted accountability - we have a working model for this that uses non transferable work weighted governance tokens.  

</p><p>
Back to the idea of using physical force to limit utility to monetizable units.

</p><p>
If you personally wind up receiving monetary value for forcibly displacing others, look in the mirror.  You may have sold non-monetizable value - personal integrity - that you cannot buy back.
